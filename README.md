This is a simple code that can be used to automatically press buttons. I initially made this to automate pressing download buttons when installing Vortex collections for my Skyrim. The code takes a screenshot every 5 seconds(configurable). Then it uses easyocr to analyze screenshots and look for a button shape. Then the code checks the text inside the button if it matches the texts given in the code. If the text matches, the code will press the button.

I made this code to be useful to me, and also to learn coding skills.
